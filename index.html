		<p>In the Mood for Food</p>


				  
	</div>

	<div class="intro">
		<p>The story for “In the Mood for Food” is essentially telling the story of two immigrants, one from China and one from Taiwan, and the history of their childhood in relation to food. From there, they compare how Americanized Chinese food to actual Chinese food from China. The story shows how much of an impact food has in our lives and how closely it ties with culture and upbringing.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-5">
        <p>With a growing population of 2.3 million in 2016, Chinese immigrants are the “third-largest foreign-born group on the United States” (migrationpolicy.org). Whether they are international students coming in for a foreign education or migrants looking for better working opportunities, what ties these two demographics together is a shared culture in food.</p> 

        <p>In Chinese and Taiwanese culture, food plays a major role in everyday life because of the importance of using raw materials to create a dish that can be shared with a table of people. Recipes themselves can be adapted, molded, changed, or substituted, but the end result is still Chinese food whether the family is lower class or upper class.</p>

        <p>We interviewed two people from different demographics; Grace*, an immigrant from China who owns an Asian fusion restaurant, and Michelle, an international student from Taiwan studying design. </p>

        <p>(*Some names and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals.)</p>
		
		<h4>Q: Where are you from?</h4>
		<h5>Grace:</h5> <p>Fujian, China</p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> <p>Kaohsiung, Taiwan </p>
						   
		<h4>Q: What are your eating habits?</h4>				
        <h5>Grace:</h5> 
		<p>I’m not picky, so I eat everything from Chinese food, American food, Thai food, but mostly Chinese food. When I stay with my kids, I cook American style food, but when I stay with my father and mother, I eat my hometown style of food; it’s kind of flexible.</p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> 
		<p>I love to eat. I also tend to stress eat, like eating fries and junk food at midnight or just stuffing food into my mouth when I'm stressed– which is bad. I eat out with my friends, and I yelp a lot; I would even wake up early or travel far just to get the food I want to eat. I also love cooking! Although I don't cook as much now, I still like to cook when I have free time. I love searching up recipes or watching cooking videos and trying out my own recipes by creatively adding ingredients into the dish. </p>
						   
        <h4>Q: What kinds of food did you grow up eating?</h4>				
        <h5>Grace:</h5> 
		<p>I would eat seafood a lot because we lived close to the ocean, so we ate lots of crabs, shrimp, fish with bone, anything with water. Normally in the household, we eat rice, stir fry bok choy, steamed shrimp and fish. Since we opened the restaurant, there’s not enough time to cook in the house, so we usually eat express food like burritos and teriyaki with veggies.</p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> 
		<p>Taiwanese food and the food my mom cooks, which is often time healthy. She would purchase organic groceries and invest her time in choosing the best quality of meat for us. I wasn't really into boba in Taiwan until I came here; now I drink boba every week.</p>

        <h4>Q: What is your favorite kind of food?</h4>		
        <h5>Grace:</h5> 
		<p>My favorite kind of food is seafood, and mainly the foods I grew up eating. So definitely shrimp, crab, fish, anything that is in water. </p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> 
		<p>SO MANY. I love chocolate, and I'd dig anything that has chocolate in it. Chocolate with hazelnut is the best. I think it depends on my mood since I seriously love every kind of food except for seafood because I don't like the smell it has (except for fish and crab which I'm okay with).</p>
		
		<h4>Q: Do you cook? If so, what kinds of food do you cook?</h4>		
        <h5>Grace:</h5> 
		<p>Yes, I cook. For the kids, we prefer not to use the oven or microwave. Chinese food uses a lot of stir-fry and oil and steam to boil, so I usually cook them steamed broccoli and potatoes. I think American food uses the oven a lot to roast and microwave. For breakfast, sometimes we do yams with rice porridge and rice. With my parents, we make steamed crab, fried crab, clams, and soup; We like soup a lot, such as soup with scallops together. It’s similar to the foods we eat back in China. However, homestyle food is different than eating out at a restaurant in China. </p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> 
		<p>Yes! My signature dish is LuNiuRou which is just marinated beef – the recipe is from my mom. I just love experimenting with food, such as adding apple when I'm cooking chicken soup (Which is how I discovered that apple is a good ingredient when you want to add sweetness to your dish). I watch cooking videos all the time, and I would follow their recipes, too.</p>	
		
		<h4>Q: How does Chinese food in America compare to the food in the place you grew up in? What makes it different?</h4>		
        <h5>Grace:</h5> 
		<p>Very Americanized, like beef broccoli and orange chicken. For authentic Chinese style food, Evo is real Chinese style food with the stirred veggies and spice. The ingredients they use are different as well. We usually go to the Asian market and pick whatever ingredients to make the dish, like specific sauces from China. American style doesn’t use a lot of Chinese ingredients. </p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> 
		<p>The portions here are so huge, whereas in Taiwan the portion is just right for a one person serving. I think my spice tolerance improved after I came here because a lot of the Chinese food here is spicy (from the Sichuan region), and I was introduced to it by my friends. My roommate is an Indonesian who also eats heavy tasting food, so I think I was influenced by them. I also think some Chinese food here like to make the dish thick (勾芡), which is not a bad thing but just a pattern I noticed.</p>

         <h4>Q: What are your thoughts on eating Chinese food in the United States?</h4>		
        <h5>Grace:</h5> 
		<p>It makes me feel good; I lived in China for 25 years before coming here, and I’ve been in the United States for 11 years, so it’s nice to cook dishes from home when I come back from work. I would cook two dishes; one for me and my parents, and one for my kids. We don’t really like sandwiches or pizza; we like hot food and we want soup before and after eating. </p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> 
		<p>Some restaurants on campus are pretty authentic. It’s interesting to see the Chinese dishes here that are Americanized, like kung pao chicken, chow mein, orange chicken, sesame chicken.</p>	
        
		<h4>Q: Anything else to add?</h4>		
        <h5>Grace:</h5> 
		<p> Chongqing and Szechuan food are the most popular in U.S.; hotpot is also popular. </p> 
        <h5>Michelle:</h5> 
		<p>Ask me anything on food.</p>
